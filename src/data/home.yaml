  descriptions:
    - Designing with people and for people is something I love doing 9am-5pm every day on weekdays! I thrive when challenges start with “how might we”, and when solutions evolve and they are never final.
    - I believe in many design principles and goals. My previous coop at engineering driven company Aquatic Informatics has introduced me to accessible design from another angle.
    - I’m excited to tell you more, let’s connect!
