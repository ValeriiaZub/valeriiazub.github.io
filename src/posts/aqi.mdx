## About the project

The first project that I was introduced to was driven by a business case of a
“single pane of glass” — a portfolio ,or a single home for multiple families of
water quality software solutions.

## Business case

Over the past 2 years AQI acquired Sedaru (water management software company) has been acquired by Hack and Danaher (larger hardware and software F500 companies), which has created a business case to **create an “umbrella” that would unite all thee solutions (and more in the future) by putting access to all of them into one place.**

## Stakeholder interviews

Through mutual effort the team has been conducting series of stakeholders interviews with the goal to gather information from multiple working perspectives across AQI.

## Constrains

Starting the stakeholder interviews with talking to system architects I could understand how big of a gap UX has to fulfill.

### Architecture incompatibilities

Each product was designed differently and many of them would not be able to easily “adopt” the signal sign in feature.

### UX was not aware of a use case yet

At the early stages AQI design team did not have a persona that would benefit from the single sign on feature. All the known users only work within one to two products due to nature of their job responsibilities.

### UI inconsistency

Because AQI has ben acquired and have been acquiring a lot of different companies, all the products do not look consistent, thus visually stand alone.

### Business case had its blanks

Although it was clear that the main idea was to sell more products, however, the intended user would hit multiple obstacles in order to purchase $10 000 worth a year software.

## Landing on a persona

All the AQI products UX have been focused on people who themselves operate inside or outside of the plant. App home business model involved a municipal director, someone who had more control.

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="Picture of persona" image={props["marcel-persona"]} />
    <div>
        <h4>Marcel, operations manager</h4>
        <p>“I expect things to run smoothly. No surprises, bad press, or budget over-runs. A happy staff, happy board & a quiet day of fishing – that’s all I ask for.”</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Benchmarking

The one of many points made by the stakeholders was single sign on. UX got onboard with the concept because we knew that many users (due to legacy and security) store their credentials in alternative ways.

Thus, the team split competitors and single sign in models for market research and inspiration.

    <GatsbyImage alt="Considered products for benchmarking" image={props["benchamarkinng-miro-board"]} />
    <span>Considered products for benchmarking</span>
</div>

## Collaborative wire

As a design team we all have separately created set of wireframes for both MVP and target. In a design meeting we used dot voting to sort out proposed features and select a user flow.

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="Wireframes done by me for taget (left) and MVP {right). Dot-voted by team members" image={props["collaborative-wireframimg"]} />
    <span>Wireframes done by me for taget (left) and MVP (right). Dot-voted by team members</span>
</div>

## Key points

After all the generative brainstorming is was crucial to stay pragmatic and keep MVP separate from target in our visions.

### Minding scalability

MVP had to hint on its future state, yet bring enough value to the customer to be validated as a successful product.

### Recognizing technical constraints

Single sign concept has many people thinking about cross-platform data access. For UX team it is important to differentiate those in the MVP.

### Starting conversion about future branding

With more companies joining AQI there is a critical need for a unified styling and original feel.

## Defining user flows

Considering stakeholders’ visions of this product success UX team has reiterated on selected screens by developing collaboratively a user-flow. This user flow includes the key actions a user would be able to perform at the MVP and target stages.

## First round of user interviews

Although interviewed users were different personas, all the feedback could be classified into 4 main categories:

### Subscriptions in to the case in this B2B

Plant operators spend a lot of time setting their environment. Trying out new software is not a part of their day to day workflows.

### Users are craving for an “eye candy”

All the users and stakeholders have made it clear they want visual content.

### SSO is a base level

With evolving technology users were rather familiar with the concept and have been hinting on future extensions on what SSO has to offer.

### An app switcher is the main workflow element

With evolving technology users were rather familiar with the concept and have been hinting on future extensions on what SSO has to offer.

## Iterating on Design

Both user and stakeholder UI discussions have given us feedback to reconsider major UI decisions. **After an additional round of critique from the UX team I was able to iterate on the design.**

## Sign in

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['login-v1']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Problem: no band identity</h4>
        <p>At the beginning sign in page looked basic and told very little story about the brand.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['login-v2']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Solution: loads of marketing space</h4>
        <p>Improved layout idea allows for marketing and brand-recognition space.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Home

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['home-v2']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Problem: “not an eye candy” - user x</h4>
        <p>Although the page clearly communicated its purpose, none of the users showed excitement towards the tool.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['home-v2']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Solution: launcher takes up space</h4>
        <p>Solution: launcher takes up space</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Discover

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['discover-v2']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Problem: ’too much selling” - user y</h4>
        <p>Discover space felt like a store where you cannot buy anything. Mostly because none of our users do not have the authority to purchase software.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['discover-v2']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Solution: visually pleasing content</h4>
        <p>Following same pattern more visuals and more space were used.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Cross-app navigation

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['app-switcher']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Problem: Conflicting visual hierarchy</h4>
        <p>Two of the products already had within the app-switcher. Thus app home link had to be integrated within native switcher in the apps. And because each app is different is is incredibly hard to achieve perfect visual hierarchy and consistency balance.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <GatsbyImage alt="" image={props['App-switcher-target']} />
    <div>
        <h4>Solution: project-based notifications</h4>
        <p>Instead of linking people to the apps, the ideas was to link people to the projects within the app by using notification styling.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Support’s and Stakeholders’s feedback

### App Home is a digital touchpoint to all AQI products and services including training and support

In SAAS world users want to have control over all of their applications and services from one place.

### Google analytics will tell us if app home is a success

Only recently AQI started tracking activity in its applications. There is very little quantitative information UX team could use to make decisions.

### Giving SSO more value

Because there are many users who only have one app to launch, having marketing and trining content will give App Home more value to our customers.

## Presenting to stakeholders

Unfortunately the design yet was still far from the MVP vision. Thus, I had to narrow my design to digestible to build MVP version at the same time considering branding uncertainty.

<GatsbyImage alt="" image={props.home} />

## Lessons learned

### Understanding how to to design without a brand

One of the largest roadblocks was to understand how to **frame the design solution without referencing brand styling/guide.** In most of the cases companies would already have a strong brand established. **AQI has been going through a giant brand-transformation, thus visual aspect was unavailability and out of my control.** When such an essential part of UI design is missing I had to find a way to adopt by speculating which design guide is most probable to be used and framing my designer so they could be translated into a different style no problem.

### Importance of advocating for a user

Working in an engineering driven company has opened my eyes on some of the major constrains aspiring designers might face every day. Being one of 4 designers in a company with over 70 developers has taught me **how important it is to amplify voices of our current and future customers.** When entire company says “no, we do not have budget/time/interest/not our focus group”, it has been up to me and other 3 designers to frame our argument towards happy users and a successful product.

### Learning business and developer languages: translating user needs into business value

Although I have heard that different people use different vocabularies, I was fascinated how a **single argument has to be framed in various ways when talking to different stakeholders.** Each stakeholder has a different perspective on UX and the role of UX in products. More importantly, everyone had different levels of empathy towards the user. After doing multiple user testing, and inviting stakeholders to them, I was able to raise awareness for our users and develop necessary vocabulary.

## Reflection

App home has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects I have worked on as a product designer. I learned how to take on multiple tasks at the same time, collaborate with other designers, take feedback and respond to it. I discovered that the true design process is never linear, and always multidimensional. This has been a summer full of learnings and I can’t wait to apply all of them in my future projects.
