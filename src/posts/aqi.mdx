## Business case

The opportunity for this project stemmed from the imperative need to harmonize workflows across various water quality applications. As we integrated multiple new products into our portfolio, several challenges became evident:

<Grid cols={4} mobileCols={2} mobileRows={2} className="mt-50">
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">1</h4>

        <p>Increased usage of multiple product families simultaneously.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">4</h4>
        <p>Dissatisfaction with cross-app workflows and overloaded customer support.</p>
    </div>
</Grid>

## Stakeholder interviews

Understanding the project's scope required gathering insights from key stakeholders across the organization:

<Grid cols={4} mobileCols={2} mobileRows={2} className="mb-16">
    <div  className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Development team leads</h4>

## Landing on a persona

After conducting a series of user interviews, we identified a target user persona:

<Grid rows={2} mobileRows={1} mobileCols={1} className="persona3 w-90 mt-50 mrl-auto">
    <Grid cols={['1fr', '3.5fr']} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="m-justify-center">
        <GatsbyImage imgStyle={{'object-fit': 'contain'}} alt="Picture of persona Rosa who works a plant manager at a drinking water facility" className="m-w-50 m-mb-32" image={props["marcel-persona"]}/>
        <div  className="pl-48 m-pl-0">
            <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Rosa, manager at multiple water facilities</h4>
                <p>“I just want my day to run smoothly, no accidents, no sudden expences and budget overruns. happy staff and happy city rfesidents drinking clear water.”</p>
        </div>
    </Grid>
    <Grid cols={2} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="mt-16"> 
        <div>
            <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Pain points</h4>
            <p>Budget overruns, staff safety, software reliability, low technology saviness.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Goals</h4>
            <p>Ensure facilities run smoothly, monitor activities through the software.</p>
      </div>
    </Grid>
</Grid>


## Qualitative data collection accuracy

After conducting six target customer interviews, we achieved a 90% accuracy rate in feedback, providing us with a high level of confidence in our next steps.

    <UserInterviewScale/>
</div>

## User pain points 

### No time to trial new software

End users lacked the time to trial new software due to the complex setup and learning process.

### Absence of a unified and visually appealing interface

Similar workflows required different steps to perform.

### Poor connection with customer support 
Current customer support system was not acessible to end users.

## Benchmarking

To guide our design sprint, we benchmarked major competitors and identified inspiring business models.

<Overflow caption="Considered products for benchmarking">
    <GatsbyImage alt="Considered products for benchmrking were broken down into user outcomes using virtual white board." image={props["benchmarking-miro-board"]} />
</Overflow>

## Collaborative wireframing

Our team engaged in collaborative wireframing sessions, enabling each member to present their vision of a single home for multiple product families.

<Overflow caption="Wireframes done by me for taget (left) and MVP (right). ">
    <GatsbyImage className="m-auto" alt="A screenshot of a digital whiteboarding exersises done in Miro showcasing wireframes done by me for taget and MVP." image={props["collaborative-wireframimg"]} />
</Overflow>

## MVP user flow

While focusing on delivering the MVP, we maintained sight of the target development:

<div className="w-100 m-auto">
    <UserFlowMvp/>
</div>

## Trade-offs

Incorporating design thinking exercises facilitated the negotiation of the MVP by aligning it with user needs.

### Unified, not uniform UI
We recognized that achieving a uniform user interface across different technologies and data architectures was more complex than dealing with design debt.

### Newest technology is a determening success factor 
The success of the project hinged on embracing the most recent component library utilized by the development team. This modernized the look and feel of the single home.

### Supporting major contracts first
Due to limited team availability, the decision was made to prioritize support for major application user bases, followed by smaller user groups.
