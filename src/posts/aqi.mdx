## Business case

Driven by acquisition and growth, after a number of new products joined water quality portfolio, leadership suggested investigate possible solutions to resolve poor cross-app workflows.

<Grid cols={4} mobileCols={2} mobileRows={2} className="mt-50">
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">1</h4>

        <p>Current customers are upsold into more software</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">3</h4>
        <p>More users start using multiple product families at once.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">4</h4>
        <p>End users are unsatisfied with cross-app workflows, support is overloaded. </p>

## Problem statement 
<BlockQuote background="#DFECF5"> How might we allow water quality specialists acess a portfolio of projects and services in a single touch?</BlockQuote>

## Stakeholder interviews

Gathering information from multiple perspectives across the organization prior user interviews was crucial to understand scale of the project.

## Landing on a persona

Though series of user interviews a target user was defined.

    <Grid cols={['1fr', '3.5fr']} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="m-justify-center">

            <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Pain points</h4>
            <p>Budget overrund, staff safety, software crashes, low technology saviness</p>
        </div>
        <div >
            <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Goal</h4>
            <p>Have facilities run smoothly, be able to monitor activities though the software.</p>
      </div>
    </Grid>
</Grid>


## Qualitative data collection accuracy

After conducting 6 user interviews with user interviews, we had 90% accuracy in customer feedback and high certainty in next steps.

</div>

## User pain points 

### No time to trial new software

Trying out new software requires a lot of setup and learning. End users are not willing to spend their time on no-priority work.

### Lacking visual and delightful content

All the applications did not look unified, thus similar workflows required different steps to perform.

### Poor connection with customer support 
Current customer support system was not acessible to low permission end users, so many bugs and requests would not get resolved for ages.

## Benchmarking

During a design sprint, major competitors and inspiring business models were mapped.

    <GatsbyImage alt="Considered products for benchmrking were broken down into user outcomes using virtual white board." image={props["benchmarking-miro-board"]} />
</Overflow>

## Collaborative wireframing

Each team member had a chance to sketch and present tie vision of a single home for multiple product families.

    <GatsbyImage className="m-auto" alt="A screenshot of a digital whiteboarding exersises done in Miro showcasing wireframes done by me for taget and MVP." image={props["collaborative-wireframimg"]} />
</Overflow>

## MVP user flow

While the team was focused on delivering MVP it was important to keep in mind target development.

<div className="w-100 m-auto">
    <UserFlowMvp/>
</div>

## Trade-offs

Collaborative and including deign thinking exercises helped the team to negotiate MVP by advocating for user needs.

### Unified, not uniform UI
Different technologies and data architecture incompatibilities is a bigger debt to resolve that design debt.

### Newest technology is a determening success factor 
The determining look and feel of the single home was the the most recently updated component library that a development team was using at the time.

### Proving support to major contracts first
Limited team availability was a deciding factor to support major application user bases first, then smaller user groups.

## Success metrics

### A digital touchpoint connects all water quality products and services including training and support
Target users reportedly have control over all of their applications and services from one place.

### Increased cross app collaboration across major user groups
Google analytics reported increased activity during workday hours in less popular application features that’s connected to discovery of new workflows. 

### Reduced tech debt
In anticipation to have more products join the water quality family, it is expected that the merging transition would take less time with refracted code.

## Presented to stakeholders

## Lessons learned

### Importance of advocating for a user

Being one of 4 designers in a company with over 70 developers has taught me how important it is to amplify voices of our current and future customers. When entire company says “no, we do not have budget/time/interest/not our focus group”, it has been up to me to frame an argument to address user needs and influence to build a successful product.

### Learning business and developer languages: translating user needs into business value

Each stakeholder has a different perspective on UX and the role of UX in products. More importantly, everyone had different levels of empathy towards the user. After doing multiple user testing, and inviting stakeholders to them, growing design maturity internally was key stategy to integrsting user feedback into product design process.
