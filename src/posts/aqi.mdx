## About the project

The first project that I was introduced to was driven by a business case of a
‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù ‚Äî a portfolio, a single home for multiple families of
water quality software solutions.

## Business case

Over the past 2 years AQI acquired Sedaru (water management software company) has been acquired by Danaher (larger F500 corporation), which has created a business case to **create an ‚Äúumbrella‚Äù that would unite all thee solutions (and more in the future) by putting access to all of them into one place.**

## UX Approach 
**Team dynamics was inspired by Lean UX:** Designing Great Products with Agile Teams by Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden. **Design process was driven by the classic double dimond designer framork**, an iconic contepurary way or rediscovering and iterating on a problem.

## Stakeholder interviews

The team has been conducting series of stakeholders interviews with the goal to gather information from multiple working perspectives across AQI.

## Constrains

Starting the stakeholder interviews with talking to system architects I could understand how big of a gap UX has to fulfill.

### Architecture incompatibilities

Each product was designed differently and many of them would not be able to easily ‚Äúadopt‚Äù the signal sign in feature.

### Speculative usecase

At the early stages AQI design team did not have a persona that would enourmously benefit from the single sign on feature. All the known users only work within one to two products due to nature of their job responsibilities.

### UI inconsistency

Because AQI has ben acquired and have been acquiring a lot of different companies, all the products do not look consistent, thus visually stand alone.

### Upselling is a dark horse

Although it was clear that the main idea was to sell more products, however, the intended user would hit multiple obstacles in order to purchase $10 000 worth a year software.

## Landing on a persona

All the AQI products UX have been focused on people who themselves operate inside or outside of the plant. App home business model involved a municipal director, whow would handle multiple oprations and/or a few departments.

        </div>
        <div className="ml-16">
            <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Marcel, operations manager</h4>
            <p>‚ÄúI expect things to run smoothly. No surprises, bad press, or budget over-runs. A happy staff, happy board & a quiet day of fishing ‚Äì that‚Äôs all I ask for.‚Äù</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Benchmarking

UX got onboard with the concept of SSO quite fast because we knew that many users due to legacy and security store their credentials in alternative ways, such as sticky notes ü•≤.

Thus, the team split competitors and single sign in models for market research and inspiration.

    <GatsbyImage alt="Considered products for benchmrking were broken down into user outcomes using wirtual white board" image={props["benchmarking-miro-board"]} />
</Overflow>

## Collaborative wireframing

As a design team we all have separately created set of wireframes for both MVP and target. In a co-design session we used a few design thinking tools such as dot voting to sort out proposed features and select a user flow.

<Overflow caption="Wireframes done by me for taget (left) and MVP (right). Dot-voted by team members">
    <GatsbyImage alt="A screenshot of a digital whiteboarding exersises done in Miro showcasing wireframes done by me for taget and MVP." image={props["collaborative-wireframimg"]} />
</Overflow>

## Key points

After all the generative brainstorming is was crucial to stay pragmatic and keep MVP separate from target in our visions.

### Minding scalability

MVP had to hint on its future state, yet bring enough value to the customer to be validated as a successful product.

### Recognizing technical constraints

Single sign on concept has many people thinking about cross-platform data sharing. It was important to differentiate between those and keep MVP within basic SSO scope.

### Starting conversion about future branding

With more companies joining AQI, AQI joing Danaher, there is a critical need for a unified product design, and branding.

## Defining user flows

Considering stakeholders‚Äô visions of this product success UX team has reiterated on selected screens by creating a user-flow. These user flows include key actions a user would be able to perform at the MVP and target stages or App home maturity.

### Defined user-flow for MVP

<UserFlowMvp/>

### Defined user-flow for target

<UserFlowTarget/>

## First round of user interviews


Although interviewed users were different personas, all the feedback could be classified into 4 main categories:

### Subscriptions and trials is not a part of B2B relationship

Plant operators spend a lot of time setting their environment using heavy data. Trying out new software is not a part of their day to day workflows, simply they have no time.

### Users are craving for an ‚Äúeye candy‚Äù

All the users and stakeholders have made it clear they want pleasing visual content as a substential portfolio of App Home.

### SSO is a base level

With evolving technology users were rather familiar with the concept and have been hinting on future extensions on what SSO has to offer.

### An app switcher is the main workflow element

With evolving technology users were rather familiar with the concept and have been hinting on future extensions on what SSO has to offer.

## Iterating on Design

Both user and stakeholder UI discussions have given us feedback to reconsider major UI decisions. **After an additional round of critique from the UX team I was able to iterate on the design.**

## Support‚Äôs and Stakeholders‚Äôs feedback

### App Home is a digital touchpoint to all AQI products and services including training and support

In SAAS world users want to have control over all of their applications and services from one place.

### Google analytics will tell us if app home is a success

Only recently AQI started tracking activity in its applications. There is very little quantitative information UX team could use to make decisions.

### Giving SSO more value

Because there are many users who only have one app to launch, having marketing and training content will give App Home more value to our customers.

## Presenting to stakeholders

Unfortunately the UX vision was still far from the MVP scope. Considering branding uncertainty I had to narrow my design to a digestible vision to present as our MVP strategy.

    <GatsbyImage alt="A mock-up of app home main page which illustraits current products user have subscribed to" image={props['app-home-final']} />
</Overflow>

## Lessons learned

### Understanding how to do design without branding in mind

One of the largest roadblocks was to understand how to **frame the design solution without referencing brand styling/guide.** In most of the cases companies would already have a strong brand established. **AQI has been going through a giant brand-transformation, thus visual aspect was unavailability and out of my control.** When such an essential part of UI design is missing I had to find a way to adopt by speculating which design guide is most probable to be used and framing my designer so they could be translated into a different style no problem.

### Importance of advocating for a user

Working in an engineering driven company has opened my eyes on some of the major constrains aspiring designers might face every day. Being one of 4 designers in a company with over 70 to 100 developers has taught me **how important it is to amplify voices of our current and future customers.** When entire company says ‚Äúno, we do not have budget/time/interest/not our focus group‚Äù, it has been up to me and other 3 designers to frame our argument towards happy users and a successful product.

### Learning business and developer languages: translating user needs into business value

Although I have heard that different people use different vocabularies, I was fascinated how a **single argument has to be framed in various ways when talking to different stakeholders.** Each stakeholder has a different perspective on UX and the role of UX in products. More importantly, everyone had different levels of empathy towards the user. After doing multiple user testing, and inviting stakeholders to them, I was able to raise awareness for our users and develop necessary vocabulary.

## Reflection

App home has been **one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects I have worked on as a product designer**. I learned how to take on multiple tasks at the same time, collaborate with other designers, take feedback and respond to it. I discovered that the true design process is never linear, and always multidimensional. This has been a summer full of learnings and I can‚Äôt wait to apply all of them in my future projects.
