## About the project

The first project that I was introduced to was driven by a business case of a
‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù ‚Äî a portfolio, a single home for multiple families of
water quality software solutions.

## Problem statement 
<BlockQuote background="#DFECF5"> How might we allow water quality specialists acess a portfolio of projects and services in a single touch?</BlockQuote>

## Stakeholder interviews

A series of stakeholders interviews were conducted with the goal to gather information from multiple working perspectives.

<Grid cols={4} mobileCols={2} mobileRows={2} className="mb-16">
    <div  className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Senior Developers</h4>

## Constraints and assumptions

Starting the stakeholder interviews with talking to system architects I could understand major project challenges.

### Architecture incompatibilities

Each product was designed differently and many of them would not be able to easily ‚Äúadopt‚Äù the signal sign in feature.

### Usecase to be discovered

All the known users only work within one to two products due to nature of their work responsibilities. There was little insight how people mightcoordinate multiple workflows.

### Design maturity
There was an opportunity to grow UX culture and the state of thr design by defining "seamless UX."

## Benchmarking

UX got onboard with the concept of SSO quite fast because we knew that many users due to legacy and security store their credentials in alternative ways, such as sticky notes ü•≤.

Thus, the team split competitors and single sign in models for market research and inspiration.

    <GatsbyImage alt="Considered products for benchmrking were broken down into user outcomes using wirtual white board" image={props["benchmarking-miro-board"]} />
</Overflow>

## Wireframing

During the design sprint the team reviewed proposed features and a user flow was selected.

<Overflow caption="Wireframes done by me for taget (left) and MVP (right). ">
    <GatsbyImage className="m-auto" alt="A screenshot of a digital whiteboarding exersises done in Miro showcasing wireframes done by me for taget and MVP." image={props["collaborative-wireframimg"]} />
</Overflow>

## Key points

After all the generative brainstorming is was crucial to stay pragmatic and keep MVP separate from target.

### Minding scalability

MVP had to hint on its future state, yet bring enough value to the customer to be validated as a successful product.

### Recognizing technical constraints

Single sign on concept has many people thinking about cross-platform data sharing. It was important to differentiate between those and keep MVP within the scope.

## Landing on a persona

Though series of user interviews a target user was defined.

    <Grid cols={['1fr', '3.5fr']} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="m-justify-center">

            <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Rosa, manager at multiple water facilities</h4>

        </div>
    </Grid>
    <Grid cols={2} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="mt-16"> 
        <div>
            <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Pain points</h4>
            <p>Budget overrund, staff safety, software crashes, low technology saviness</p>
        </div>
        <div >
            <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Goal</h4>
            <p>Have facilities run smoothly, be able to monitor activities though the software.</p>
      </div>
    </Grid>
</Grid>

## Insights from user interviews

All the feedback could be classified into 4 main categories:

### Subscriptions and trials is not a part of B2B relationship in water quality

Plant operators spend a lot of time setting their environment using heavy data. Trying out new software is not a part of their day to day workflows, simply they have no time.

### Users are craving for an ‚Äúeye candy‚Äù

All the users and stakeholders have made it clear they want pleasing visuals as a substential portfolio content.


## User flow for MVP

Considering stakeholders‚Äô visions of this product success UX team has reiterated on selected screens by creating a user-flow. These user flows include key actions a user would be able to perform at the MVP and target stages of SSO.

<div className="w-100 m-auto">
    <UserFlowMvp/>
</div>

## User testing

Both user and stakeholder UI discussions have given us feedback to reconsider major UI decisions. **After an additional round of critique from the UX team I was able to iterate on the design.**

## Stakeholders‚Äô feedback

### App Home is a digital touchpoint to all AQI products and services including training and support

In SAAS world users want to have control over all of their applications and services from one place.

### Google analytics will tell us if app home is a success

This project helped the UX team to sraticulate the importasnce of lacking quantitatinve data.

### Giving SSO more value

Because there are many users who only have one app to launch, having marketing and training content will introduce current customers to a larger suite of products.

## Presenting to stakeholders

Following agile methodologies, the MVP was condenced to help stakeholders digest design decisions. Branding and marketing strategies were not part of the major converations just yet.

<Overflow caption="Final design proposed to the larger stakeholders as MVP for App Home">
    <GatsbyImage alt="A mock-up of app home main page which illustraits current products user have subscribed to" image={props['app-home-final']} />
</Overflow>

## Lessons learned

### Understanding how to design without a brand

One of the largest roadblocks was to understand how to **frame the design solution without referencing brand styling/guide.** I had to find a way to adopt by speculating which design guide is most probable to be used and framing my design so it could be translated into a different style with as little effort as possible.

### Importance of advocating for a user

Working in an engineering driven company has opened my eyes on some of the major constrains aspiring designers might face every day. Being one of 4 designers in a company with over 70 to 100 developers has taught me **how important it is to better articlate design decisions though amplifying voices of our current and future customers.** 

### Learning business and developer languages: translating user needs into business value
Although I have heard that different people use different vocabularies, I was fascinated how a **single argument has to be framed in various ways when talking to different stakeholders.** Each stakeholder has a different perspective on UX and the role of UX in products. More importantly, everyone had different levels of empathy towards the user. After doing multiple user testing, and inviting stakeholders to them, I was able to raise awareness for our users and develop necessary vocabulary.

## Reflection

App home has been **one of the most challenging yet rewarding projects I have worked on as a  designer**. I learned how to take on multiple tasks at the same time, collaborate with other designers, take feedback and respond to it. I discovered that the true design process is never linear, and always multidimensional. This has been a summer full of learnings and I can‚Äôt wait to apply all of them in my future projects.
