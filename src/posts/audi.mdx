## About the challenge

Our journey began with a profound exploration of shared mobility and the shifting dynamics of car sales. Through four immersive events,  ** we engaged with Audi professionals, engineers, sales representatives, and dealers.** These interactions provided us with a fresh perspective on the fiercely competitive ride-sharing market and cutting-edge technology implementations in mobility services.

</Overflow>

## Market research

Mobility as a service is rather wide topic that was covers many areas of user experience. Though talking with stakeholders as well as researching growing trends **our team was interested in passenger experience** as if you were in Uber or Lyft.

## Existing myAudi App Examination

Our investigation extended to the existing myAudi app, which catered primarily to car owners and did not provide passengers with access to the premium features within the vehicle.

## User perspective

When a passenger steps into a car, they seek a tailored and immersive experience. Imagine getting into an Uber and having access to features like a seat massage. However, accessing these premium features was cumbersome, and most passengers remained oblivious to their existence without guidance from the driver.

## Problem statement


<BlockQuote background="#F0E6E6">
    How might we help Audi customers get simple access to all the premium features they might not be aware of?
</BlockQuote>


## Understanding passengers

We defined four primary categories of features for e-tron car users:

<Grid cols={4} mobileCols={2} mobileRows={2} className="w-600 m-w-100 justify-center">
    <div style={{ width: 125}} className="flex flex-center flex-column justify-between">
        <AudioVolume />
        <h5 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16 align-center">audio</h5>
    </div>
    <div style={{ width: 125}} className="flex flex-center flex-column justify-between">
        <Idea />
        <h5 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16 align-center">lighting</h5>
    </div>
    <div style={{ width: 125}} className="flex flex-center flex-column justify-between">
        <InteriorSeat />
        <h5 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16 align-center">seat control</h5>
    </div>
    <div style={{ width: 125}} className="flex flex-center flex-column justify-between">
        <ClimateAuto />
        <h5 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16 align-center">climate</h5>
    </div>
</Grid>

## Areas of focus

While the passenger experience was at the forefront, we were aware of the fact that the driver plays a pivotal role in managing the vehicle while ensuring safety. Later aim was to simplify the ride-sharing process without interfering with the driver's responsibilities.

<Grid rows={3} className="w-500 m-w-100">
    <div className="flex flex-center">
        <div className="h-100 mt-50"><ValetParking /></div>
        <div className="pl-48">
            <h2 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Security</h2>
            <p>Information confidentiality and travellers’ safety is a priority.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div className="flex flex-center">

        <div className="pl-48">
            <h2 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Control</h2>
            <p>Drivers need a way to control their vehicle at all times.</p>

        <div className="pl-48">
            <h2 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Communication</h2>
            <p>Safer driving experiences involves proper passenger communication and assistance.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</Grid>

## Designing for web

Our conversations with Audi engineers revealed that software solutions requiring access to car functionalities, such as remote start and trunk opening, must undergo rigorous security checks to ensure driver safety. Software upgrades were constrained due to high deployment costs.

### Our solution focuses on leveraging the existing myAudi application on the driver's phone to mediate between the ride-share and the car.

    display: 'grid',
    gridTemplateColumns: '100px 1fr',
   // justifyItems: 'center',
    gridGap: '12px',
    marginTop: 36

    <div className="flex flex-center  justify-center "><CirclePhone /></div>
    <p className="w-500 bold">The driver’s phone receives and approves requests from passengers’ phones.</p>
    <div className="flex flex-center  justify-center "><IndicatorsUpDown /></div>
    <div></div>
    <div className="flex flex-center  justify-center "><Car/></div>
    <p className="w-500 bold">Car dashboard accomodates and adjusts interior setings, such as audio volume and seating positions.</p>
</div>

## Prioratizing driver control

Recognizing that a single car may host up to six passengers, we designed the system to allow the driver to set tolerances for specific seats. This prevented feature request conflicts between multiple paired devices, ensuring that the driver maintains control over the car.

## Low-fidelity prototyping

To validate the visual hierarchy and the overall user experience, we used the Audi UI design system and created low-fidelity wireframes.

<Grid cols={3} rows={2} mobileCols={2} mobileRows={3}>
    <GatsbyImage alt="wireframe for thr home page for audi connect that leads to lights, seat controlls, climate, and audio" image={props['wireframe-home']}/>
    <GatsbyImage alt="wireframe for thr home page for audi connect seat selection that lets you to select your seat" image={props['wireframe-seat-selection']}/>
    <GatsbyImage alt="wireframe for thr home page for audi connect  that allows you to change volume of the audio and songs" image={props['wireframe-audio']}/>
    <GatsbyImage alt="wireframe for thr home page for audi connect where you can change interior lightning" image={props['wireframe-lights']}/>

    <GatsbyImage alt="wireframe for thr home page for audi connect that lets you contol posion and massage option for your seating if applicable" image={props['wireframe-seating']}/>
</Grid>

## Lessons learned

One year later, we discovered that the marketing agency that sponsored the hackathon had developed a route tracking app for the Audi e-tron, the latest all-electric SUV at the time. Our experience at the hackathon allowed us to think boldly and envision the future. In the real world, understanding stakeholder goals and business objectives is essential. While the hackathon environment encouraged us to dream big, the practical implementation of such a solution requires a more comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. Our journey continues, and I will always be pushing the boundaries of innovation.
