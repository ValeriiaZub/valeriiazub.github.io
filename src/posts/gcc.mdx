## What is a green committee?

A Green Committee is a volunteer organization created for individuals living in multi-residential buildings to come together and collectively improve their neighborhoods, reduce waste, and promote sustainability.
## Problem statement

<BlockQuote background="#cde2cc59">
    How might we help people living in multi-residential buildings during pandemic reduce individual household waste and encourage more participation in volunteer groups??

## Collecting information from the user interviews

Our user interviews revealed several key insights:

<Grid rows={3} className="w-500 m-w-100">
    <div className="flex flex-center">
        <div className="h-100 mt-50 min-w-30"><People /></div>
        <div className="pl-48">
            <h2 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Lack of a single communication line</h2>
            <p>Because many people are coming from different generations, they all are using various messengers and platforms for communication. User interviews have shown that if a person would not know how to reach out they wold be reluctant to look up how.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div className="flex flex-center">
        <div className="h-100 mt-50 min-w-30 "><Paper /></div>
        <div className="pl-48">
            <h2 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Difficulty to find resources </h2>
            <p>Many interview participants pointed out that they would still want to try and manage their household waste, however, their main point of resources were people. Once they stopped seeing people due to covid-19, they found it daunting to look for multiple resources on the web, since recycling and waste practices in Toronto are not uniform.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div className="flex flex-center">
        <div className="h-100 mt-50 min-w-30 "><Lightbulb /></div>
        <div className="pl-48">
            <h2 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Decline is household waste management </h2>
            <p>With reduced exposure to better practices and social pressures during the pandemic, individuals were less motivated to manage their household waste.</p>

## Landing on personas
Two personas emerged from our research:

<Grid rows={2} mobileRows={1} mobileCols={1} className="persona1 w-90 mt-100 mrl-auto">
    <Grid cols={['1fr', '3.5fr']} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="m-justify-center">
        <GatsbyImage imgStyle={{'object-fit': 'contain'}} alt="A photo of a younger latino man weating a suit, having his hair styled back" className="m-w-50 m-mb-32" image={props.persona1}/>
        <div  className="pl-48 m-pl-0">
            <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">James, green committee lead</h4>
                <p>“It has been <strong>difficult to have new people join. Because of Covid-19 I find It hard to talk to other members from different groups.</strong> People used to do great things together, now we stay home.”</p>
        </div>
    </Grid>
    <Grid cols={2} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="mt-16"> 
        <div>
            <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Pain points</h4>
            <p>Psychical isolation, lack of communication. </p>
        </div>
        <div >
            <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Goal</h4>

    </Grid>
    <Grid cols={2} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={1} className="mt-16"> 
      <div className="w-90">
          <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Pain points</h4>
          <p>Lack of accessible resources, lack of self-activism.</p>
      </div>
        <div className="w-90">
          <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Goal</h4>
          <p>Get involved into the movements, meet new people</p>
      </div>
    </Grid>
</Grid>

## Project goals

Our project goals revolved around four core areas:

<Grid cols={3} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={3}> 
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Clear information architecture</h4>
        <p>Ensuring that text was easy to read and that articles followed a consistent structure.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Easy navigation</h4>
        <p>Structuring resources for easy access and consistent website architecture.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Inclusive web design</h4>
        <p>Implementing responsive design and accessible color schemes.</p>
    </div>
</Grid>


## Information architechture

We tackled the challenge of organizing a large amount of information into a simple and navigable website. The resulting architecture included sections for success stories, resources, involvement in existing committees, and information for those wanting to start a committee.

<Overflow caption="Information architecture flowchart.">
   <GccFlowchart/>
</Overflow>

## From wireframes to website
Iterating through various design stages, we developed a design that allowed users to sort information for easy access. The team ultimately chose to use WIX as a website builder, which did impose some design limitations.
<GatsbyImage alt="A user interface sketches using original content provided by the team: understand how to educe waste and be greener." image={props.wireframes}/>
<Overflow caption="Wireframes, the first design stage."></Overflow>

## Making colours accessible
In a bid to make the design accessible, I proposed a slightly altered color palette while maintaining the brand's identity.
<GatsbyImage alt=" " image={props.newColours}/>
<Overflow caption="Before and after adjusted colours for better visual accessibility."></Overflow>


## Handing off the website to the team
The website was handed over with instructions on how to update content, design for mobile and desktop, and reorganize the webpage. The goal was to ensure that the team could maintain the website easily in the future.
<Grid cols={2}>
    <GatsbyImage alt="A user interface with two main options leading to articles: find what your committee needs the most, and I'm already part of the" image={props.findResources} />
    <div className="flex flex-center justify-center flex-column">
        <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Helping different people find relevant information</h4>
        <p className="mr-90">We designed small sections to guide individuals with different backgrounds toward the most relevant information.</p>
    </div>
</Grid>

<Grid cols={2}>
    <GatsbyImage alt="A screenshot of resourceful links about low waste life" image={props.sortResources} />
    <div className="flex flex-center justify-center flex-column">
        <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Resourceful library of links in one place </h4>
        <p className="mr-90">The resource library offered a wealth of information, allowing individuals seeking environmental and waste management resources to access a wide variety of articles with no effort.</p>
    </div>
</Grid>

<Grid cols={2}>
    <GatsbyImage alt="A screenshot of featured challenges, activities people can do alone to feel as a part of a community." image={props.challenges} />
    <div className="flex flex-center justify-center flex-column">
        <h4 className="w-100 f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Inspiring challenges to power your community</h4>
        <p className="mr-90">As more people joined the Facebook group, we posted challenges and success stories publicly to engage a broader audience.</p>
    </div>
</Grid>

## How does it look now?
The website was published in February 2021.

## Lessons learned
### Syncing with the team in a short period of time
Throughout this journey, I gained valuable insights into the importance of syncing with the team quickly, setting clear expectations, and understanding the user's needs. 
### Importance of learning about the user
This experience reinforced the significance of immersing oneself in the user's world to design a meaningful solution.
