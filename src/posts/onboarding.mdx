## Background

Being a part of a mega-corp means to produce good products for users you must collaborate with different organizations. For this project, I was looking how we can sell more of in-house flooding software to users from a newly acquired company who use flooding sensors.

## Areas of business opportunity
Dedicating time towards strategy was a key to a successful outcome. We looked into what our potential users can be lacking.
<Grid cols={3} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={3} className="mt-50">
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Enhanced flooding maps</h4>
        <p>Including topographical data could help users predict floods in action with accuracy.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Software package deals</h4>
        <p>Introducing new subscription plan to new customers could make it more appealing for them to transition.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Simple setup</h4>
        <p>If well known long setup becomes shorter, people will be less reluctant to try.</p>
    </div>
</Grid>

## Problem statement 
<BlockQuote background="#EDEDF8"> How might we help hydrologists and flooding specialists from small municipalities respond to floods immediately after purchasing software?</BlockQuote>

## Final design

After evaluating all the business opportunities, a simple onboarding helps flooding responders setup their data in minutes.

## Iterative process - design sprint

I was coming to this project with 0 understanding of flood monitoring. Because I knew that the team will get it wrong many times, iterative approach to design was selected. 

###  Day 1: problem & outcomes

### Day 2: what we know today - expert interviews 

### Day 3: competitor research 

### Day 4: together-alone solution sketching  

### Day 5: user journey mega map + planning 


## User testing - key leanings

The team selected 7 municipality flooding experts to test mock-ups. Though conversations we found out that only 5 are potential target users, which has helped the team to narrow down the MVP.

## Impact

### 200 times faster setup
Most importantly, small municipalities will be able to start using software by themselves without spending months on training.
### Increased product interest
Easy setup made  the product more appealing to many other customers, who do not have sensors we wanted to integrate with.
### Unified user experience
User testing showed higher delightful feedback from the users. It is bringing the user experience together from purchase to everyday use.
