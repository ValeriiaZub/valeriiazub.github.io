## Background

In a corporate landscape, the need to foster strong cross-organizational collaborations is paramount for delivering exceptional products to our users. This project delves into enhancing the onboarding experience for new users of flood sensors from a recently acquired company, with the goal of promoting the adoption of our in-house flood monitoring software.

## Strategic focus
Devoting time to strategize was instrumental in our success. We identified the following areas of opportunity:
<Grid cols={3} mobileCols={1} mobileRows={3} className="mt-50">
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Enhanced flood maps</h4>
        <p>Topographical data could significantly enhance the accuracy of flood predictions.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Software subscription plans</h4>
        <p>The introduction of new subscription plans for prospective customers can facilitate their transition due to low initial costs.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="p-16">
        <h4 className="f-24 mb-16 mt-16">Simplified setup</h4>
        <p>Streamlining the typically complex setup process can encourage more people to try new solutions.
</p>
    </div>
</Grid>

## Problem statement 
<BlockQuote background="#EDEDF8"> How can we facilitate immediate flood response for hydrologists and flooding specialists in small municipalities who have just acquired our software</BlockQuote>

## Final design
After rounds of collaboration, user and stakeholder interviews, a simple onboarding was designed to enable flood responders to set up their data within minutes.

## Iterative process - design sprint

Recognizing my lack of prior knowledge in flood monitoring, we chose an iterative approach to the design:

###  Day 1: problem definition & outcomes

### Day 2: expert interviews and knowledge gathering

### Day 3: competitive research 

### Day 4: collaborative solution sketching  

### Day 5: user journey maping and planning 


## User testing - key leanings

We engaged with seven municipality flooding experts to test our mock-ups. Through these conversations, we identified five potential target users, which allowed us to focus on building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

                <p>Uploading flooding data was a cumbersome task, particularly for small municipalities with up to 300 locations to monitor. Filling out nine fields per location was time-consuming.</p>
